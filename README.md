## 💬 About

Hey, Aristo here! 👋

I'm a mid-level software engineer based in sunny Singapore.

My current work revolves around the full-stack development of loyalty platforms for major banks & FIs across the globe at [Ascenda](https://www.ascendaloyalty.com/).

Outside of work, I am a Web3 enthusiast who closely follows developments around cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and NFTs.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- Starting to share some of my adventurous projects. You can read about them in [my blog](https://blog.wilbertaristo.com)! Will be adding more in the near future 😉

## 🛠️ Notable Projects

- [**Portfolio website**](https://wilbertaristo.com) - A portofolio website developed from scratch using NextJs 13 and framer-motion for animations. No templates, no website builder, and definitely no outsourced work were ever used. 100% handmade with passion.
