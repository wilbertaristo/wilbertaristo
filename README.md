## 💬 About

Hey, Aristo here! 👋

I'm a mid-level software engineer based in sunny Singapore.

My current work revolves around the frontend development of loyalty platforms for major banks across the globe at Ascenda.

Outside of work, I am a Web3 enthusiast who closely follows developments around cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and NFTs.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- Building my portfolio website, handmade from scratch with NextJs 13 and framer-motion for animations. No templates, no website builder, nada. Stay tuned for the release!

- Starting to share some of my adventurous projects. You can read about them in [my blog](https://aristo.hashnode.dev/)! Will be adding more in the near future 😉
